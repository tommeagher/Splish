# Splish

This was a fork of [Joey Marburger](https://www.github.com/joeymarburger)'s [Bootcard website design](https://github.com/joeymarburger/Bootcard). 
I used this on a previous version of [my personal website](http://www.tommeagher.com/) but have since changed the layout. Regardless, it's a nice, simple and effective design that's worth taking a look at.
